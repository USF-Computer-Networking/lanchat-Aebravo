lanscan.py pings all possible addresses in your network to see who is active on your lan. I modified code from a youtube to tutorial
and stackoverflow so that all possible network addressess are iterated through and pinged. I could possibbly implement multithreading
to this program to substantially increase the running time. Simply enter "python lanscan.py" into the terminal to run the program.
